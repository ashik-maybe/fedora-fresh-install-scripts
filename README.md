## Notes

- **Wayland Support**: The custom `.desktop` files (`brave-browser.desktop` and `google-chrome.desktop`) ensure that Brave and Chrome use Wayland instead of X11. This is particularly useful for users running Fedora with GNOME on Wayland.
  
- **Customization**: The scripts are designed to be flexible. You can skip certain steps or modify the scripts to suit your specific needs.

- **Compatibility**: These scripts are tested on Fedora Workstation (GNOME desktop). If you're using a different desktop environment, some features (e.g., GNOME Tweaks) may not apply.
